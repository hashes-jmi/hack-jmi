 # Idea/Solution/Prototype

#### Website

_We are aiming to build a solution that takes input of the student’s engagement from a camera or webcam and act accordingly. We will be using AI to convert the facial expressions of the student to their level of understanding and then pace the level of study accordingly. Basically we want to create learning a better experience._

				Technology Stack
###### Website:
Frontend: Html, Css, JavaScript, React js , Solidity , Web3.js
Backend: Node js
Real time Database: Firebase
And various node modules for implementing the AI algorithm.

##### Use Case :
When the student’s engagement in the video or lecture falls beyond a certain level then a chatbot in our webapp will automatically prompt the student to give some interesting answers.
The quizzes in the webapp will also be interesting as the student can give answer just by speaking and then we will convert voice into text to check if the user has given correct answer or not.
###### The idea is designed into 4 main components.
1.	The first interface will be for the student where he/she can log in.  

2.	The second component is the sensor which may be a camera or a sensor which takes input of the student’s facial expression expressions and convert them into engagement level.

3.	Then the AI will decide how the pace the course for that particular student depending upon the understanding level of the student. The AI system consists of the following components:

_a.	The AI can pace the course slow or fast according to the engagement level of the student.
_b.	The quizzes in the course are made more interactive by using Voice to Text recognition.
_c.	A chatbot is available for any help needed by the student.
_d.	The AI will also provide referral links for the related material needed by the student so as to provide more comprehensive study material for the student.

4.	The last interface is that of the administrator where they can see the progress of the student in form of graphs and also analyse where the student is lacking behind. 

##### Key Highlights
The lecture or video will start or stop according to the student engagement, as if the student is not seeing or seeing here and there then the video will automatically be stopped.
